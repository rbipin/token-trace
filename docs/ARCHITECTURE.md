## Overview

TokenTracer is a local-first pipeline. **Collectors** read session artifacts
that supported CLI/editor surfaces already write to disk, normalize them into `SessionRecord`s, and
a **pipeline** deduplicates them, runs them through an ordered **middleware**
chain (e.g. model-name normalization), and writes them to **stores** (always
a local SQLite database, optionally remote sinks such as Supabase). The
**reporter** aggregates the local database for display. The design is
Open/Closed: adding a new data source, a new middleware, or a new sink
requires implementing one protocol and registering it — no other module
changes.

## Codex daily accounting

Codex uses the optional `BatchActivityCollector.collect_batch(since)` capability.
`Paths.codex_home` defaults to `~/.codex`, respects `CODEX_HOME`, and permits
explicit injection. `src/collectors/codex_cli.py` discovers nested active and
archived JSONL rollouts by recent local mtime, then reads their complete available
histories in streaming passes. Metadata session IDs survive archive moves and
renaming. Projects use the existing resolver, and raw paths/conversation content
never enter batches or sync payloads.

The pipeline wraps session-only collectors in `CollectionBatch`, merges sessions
by their existing raw key, deduplicates events by `(source,session_id,event_id)`,
stamps context on both, and invokes optional `process_events()` middleware.
SQLite receives one atomic batch; session-only primary stores retain summaries
with an explicit unsupported-event notice. Ordinary remote retries use the same
`run_sync()` path as the post-collect sweep.

Per-response `token_usage_record` counts take precedence. Older cumulative
snapshots yield component deltas only with a defensible baseline; repeated
snapshots contribute nothing. Missing/null accounting does not fabricate a zero
request. Decreases without an explicit fresh-accounting marker and uncertain
inherited history are partial. Explicit thread IDs exclude copied fork history.
When known descendants make a parent's cumulative ownership uncertain, parent
snapshots are retained for audit but excluded from accepted reports. Supported
child response records remain attributable to their originating session.

| Relation | Identity / purpose |
|---|---|
| `sessions` | Lifetime metadata and accepted totals, keyed by `(session_id,source,model)` |
| `usage_events` | Raw immutable accounting identities `(source,session_id,event_id)`; corrected values are upserted |
| `usage_coverage` | Session status `measured`, `partial`, or `unavailable`; absent marker means legacy |
| `usage_event_sync_log` | Independent acknowledgment per event and remote store |
| `usage_daily` | Accepted per-model local-day usage; lifetime metadata retained separately |
| `reporting_usage` | Daily ledger rows plus exclusively uncovered legacy sessions |

Events persist UTC timestamps and local dates/historical offsets. Existing event
dates and offsets survive timezone changes. Caches are removed from inclusive
input and stored separately; reasoning remains a subset of output. Footprint is
a single request's inclusive input plus output. Corrections clear affected event
acknowledgments; acknowledgments compare revisions so an in-flight stale push
cannot hide a correction. Coverage changes also invalidate session sync markers.
Atomic rollback protects all three batch relations.

All dashboard usage surfaces and CLI period rollups use `reporting_usage`.
Session views regroup scoped daily rows by raw session/model identity and label
lifetime timestamps/activity. Distinct source/session counts avoid inflation
across models and days; cache efficiency is period-scoped. Attribution metadata
exposes legacy tokens plus partial/unavailable-session counts, including sessions
without reportable events. `--detailed` is a raw session diagnostic. Entry points
prepare additive local schema before reading older databases.

Remote event support is optional and explicitly enabled by `usage_table` after
operators apply `docs/migrations/2026-10-08-usage-events.sql` (adapt default table
names if configured otherwise). Session and event retries/acknowledgments are
independent per store, and dry-run reports both counts without remote writes.
Event-aware session batches carry `usage_coverage` and `usage_coverage_reason`.
Remote consumers must exclude covered legacy summaries, prefer response events
over snapshots within each session, and omit snapshot deltas with reason
`ambiguous descendant cumulative usage ownership`. Summing the raw audit table
would reintroduce superseded or ambiguously owned usage.

## Collect flow

`tracker.py collect` builds the pipeline in `_build_pipeline()` (in `src/commands/collect.py`) and runs it:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as tracker.py collect
    participant P as TrackerPipeline
    participant CC as CopilotCliCollector
    participant CL as ClaudeCliCollector
    participant PR as ProjectNameResolver
    participant PI as ProjectIdentityStore
    participant MW as Middleware chain
    participant SQ as SqliteStore
    participant RM as Remote stores

    CLI->>P: .context(label).add(collectors).middlewares(...).since(today - lookback).stores(...).run()
    par ThreadPoolExecutor
        P->>CC: collect(since)
        CC->>PR: resolve(display_name, cwd)
        PR->>PI: resolve_guid/resolve_whimsical (mode=no/whimsical)
        PI-->>PR: stable guid or whimsical name
        PR-->>CC: sessions.project value
        CC-->>P: SessionRecords
    and
        P->>CL: collect(since)
        CL->>PR: resolve(display_name, cwd)
        PR->>PI: resolve_guid/resolve_whimsical (mode=no/whimsical)
        PI-->>PR: stable guid or whimsical name
        PR-->>CL: sessions.project value
        CL-->>P: SessionRecords
    end
    P->>P: merge_records() — dedupe by (session_id, source, model)
    P->>P: stamp context label on every record
    P->>MW: for each middleware: applies(records)? -> process(records)
    MW-->>P: transformed records
    P->>SQ: upsert(records)  — must succeed, errors propagate
    P->>RM: upsert(records)  — parallel, log-and-continue
    P-->>CLI: RunResult(records_written, errors, stores_failed)
```

Key invariants:

- **Idempotent** — re-running `collect` overwrites existing rows. The merge
  key is `(session_id, source, model)`; upsert is last-write-wins
  (`INSERT OR REPLACE`). There is no summation across runs.
- **Read-only sources** — collectors never write to the files they read.
- **Fault isolation** — a collector exception is caught and reported as a
  warning; other collectors still run. The local SQLite write must succeed;
  remote store failures are logged without blocking.
- The lookback window defaults to 3 days (`--lookback N` to backfill).
- **Middleware runs after merge, before persistence** — each registered
  middleware's `applies()` gates whether its `process()` runs; middlewares
  chain in registration order. See [Middleware](#middleware).

`ProjectNameResolver` applies the shared tri-state naming policy before a
record reaches the pipeline. Collectors pass source-specific `(display_name,
cwd)` pairs into `resolve()`: `"yes"` returns the real display name, `"no"`
stores a stable 12-hex guid derived from `cwd`, and `"whimsical"` stores a
stable docker-style masked name tied to that same guid.

### The record model

`SessionRecord` (`src/models.py`) is a **frozen dataclass** — one row per
`(session_id, source, model)`. Because it's frozen, nothing may mutate a
record in place; transforms (including middleware `process()`) must build a
new instance with `dataclasses.replace()`. Fields: `date`, `start_ts`, `end_ts`,
`project`, `turns`, `tool_calls`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`,
`cache_creation_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `context_peak_tokens`,
`reasoning_tokens`, `context` (the usage-context label, e.g.
`"work"`/`"personal"`), and `canonical_model` (nullable; populated by
`ModelNormalizeMiddleware` — see [Middleware](#middleware)).

---

## Data sources

Collectors implement the `ActivityCollector` protocol
(`src/collectors/base.py`): a `source: str` class attribute plus
`collect(since: date) -> Iterable[SessionRecord]`.

### Copilot CLI (`src/collectors/copilot_cli.py`, source = `copilot_cli`)

Reads **two** artifact kinds under `~/.copilot/`:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DB[("~/.copilot/session-store.db<br/>sessions table")] -->|"id, cwd, repository,<br/>start/end timestamps"| L{{for each session}}
    L --> EV["~/.copilot/session-state/&lt;session-id&gt;/events.jsonl"]
    EV --> SD{"session.shutdown<br/>event present?"}
    SD -->|yes — completed session| MM["modelMetrics: per-model token breakdown<br/>→ one SessionRecord per (session, model)"]
    SD -->|no — active session| AM["sum assistant.message usage<br/>→ one SessionRecord, model from first message"]
```

**1. `session-store.db`** — a SQLite database with a `sessions` table
providing session id, `cwd`, `repository`, and start/end timestamps. Two
schema generations are supported (detected via `PRAGMA table_info`):

| Schema | Start column | End column |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old CLI | `startedAt` | `endedAt` |
| New CLI (≥ mid-2026) | `created_at` | `updated_at` |

Sessions starting before `since` are skipped. The collector passes
`(repo_name or cwd_basename, row["cwd"])` into the shared resolver:
`--project-mode yes` stores the real project name, `no` stores the stable guid
for that cwd, and `whimsical` stores the stable masked name for that cwd.

**2. `session-state/<session-id>/events.jsonl`** — the per-session event log.
Newer CLI versions nest each event's payload under a `data` key; the collector
reads `event.get("data") or event` to handle both. Two parse paths:

- **Completed sessions** write a `session.shutdown` event containing
  `modelMetrics` — a per-model breakdown. Each model becomes its own
  `SessionRecord`. Field layout differs by CLI generation:

  | Field | Old format | New format |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Token counts | flat on the metric dict | nested under `usage` |
  | Turns | `turns` | `requests.count` |

  Token keys (both formats): `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`,
  `cacheReadTokens`, `cacheWriteTokens`, `reasoningTokens`.

- **Active sessions** (no shutdown event yet) fall back to summing
  `assistant.message` events. The new format exposes only output tokens
  there — full input/cache counts arrive at shutdown, and the next
  `collect` run overwrites the row with the final numbers.

- **Tool calls** — `tool.execution_complete` events are counted as they
  are encountered. When a shutdown event is present the counts are
  attributed per model via each event's `model` field; without a shutdown
  event the total is attributed to the single detected model. The event
  scan no longer stops early at `session.shutdown` so tool events that
  follow the shutdown marker are captured.

- **Context peak** — before event parsing begins, the collector runs one
  bulk query against `assistant_usage_events` in `session-store.db`:

  ```sql
  SELECT session_id, model, MAX(input_tokens + output_tokens) AS peak
  FROM assistant_usage_events
  WHERE agent_id IS NULL
  GROUP BY session_id, model
  ```

  `agent_id IS NULL` excludes subagent requests. `input_tokens` in this
  table is cache-inclusive, so `input_tokens + output_tokens` is the full
  per-request footprint. Results are loaded into a
  `dict[(session_id, model)] -> peak` and attached to each record as
  `context_peak_tokens`. If the table does not exist (`OperationalError`),
  the dict is empty and all peaks default to `0` — no warning is emitted.

  The `assistant_usage_events` table schema:

  | Column | Meaning |
  | --- | --- |
  | `session_id` | session the request belongs to |
  | `turn_index` | conversation turn |
  | `agent_id` | `NULL` for main conversation; set for subagents |
  | `model` | model id for the request |
  | `input_tokens` | total prompt tokens (cache-inclusive) |
  | `output_tokens` | response tokens |
  | `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, `reasoning_tokens` | breakdown fields |

### Claude CLI (`src/collectors/claude_cli.py`, source = `claude_cli`)

Each Claude Code conversation is one JSONL file:

```
~/.claude/projects/<project-id>/<conversation-id>.jsonl
```

- The **file stem is the `session_id`**; one `SessionRecord` per file.
- Files whose **mtime** predates the lookback window are skipped without
  being opened (cheap pre-filter); the session start date is then checked
  against `since` after parsing.
- Only entries with `type: "assistant"` carry usage. Each one counts as a
  turn and contributes `message.usage` fields:

  | JSONL key | SessionRecord field |
  | --- | --- |
  | `input_tokens` | `input_tokens` |
  | `output_tokens` | `output_tokens` |
  | `cache_creation_input_tokens` | `cache_creation_tokens` |
  | `cache_read_input_tokens` | `cache_read_tokens` |

- **Tool calls** — `tool_use` content blocks within each assistant
  message's `content` list are counted into `tool_calls`. Messages with
  string content are skipped safely.

- **Context peak** — for each assistant message the collector computes the
  per-message token footprint:

  ```
  input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + output_tokens
  ```

  The maximum across all messages becomes `context_peak_tokens` on the
  record. `input_tokens` here **excludes** cache, so all cache components
  are added explicitly. `reasoning_tokens` stays `0` — the Claude CLI JSONL
  has no source field for it.

- Session `start_ts`/`end_ts` are the min/max `timestamp` across all
  entries; the model comes from the first assistant `message.model`.
  The collector passes `(cwd_basename, first_cwd_seen)` into the shared
  resolver, so `sessions.project` holds either the real directory name,
  the stable guid, or the stable whimsical mask for that cwd.

### Why no VS Code / Web / Desktop collectors

Those surfaces render token data live in the UI but never persist it to
disk — there is nothing to collect. Do not add a collector for a surface
unless it starts persisting token data.

### `context_peak_tokens` semantics

`context_peak_tokens` represents the largest total token footprint of any
single API request within a session:

```
peak = MAX over requests of (prompt tokens + output tokens)
     where prompt tokens = input + cache read + cache write
```

Key properties:
- Values are **exact API-reported figures** — no estimation.
- Computed per `(session_id, source, model)`, matching the merge key.
- **Subagent requests are excluded** (Copilot: `agent_id IS NULL` filter;
  Claude: no subagent rows exist in the JSONL files). The peak reflects the
  main conversation context window only. Consequently, a model whose usage
  in a session came entirely from subagent requests gets
  `context_peak_tokens = 0` even though its token counts are non-zero.
- Defaults to `0` when unavailable (older Copilot installs without the
  `assistant_usage_events` table, sessions with no assistant activity). No
  fallback estimation is performed.
- Re-running `collect --lookback N` backfills peaks for sessions whose
  source files still exist.

## Middleware

Different AI CLI harnesses report model identifiers inconsistently — the same
underlying model can show up as `claude-sonnet-4.5` from one source and
`claude-sonnet-4-5-20260101` from another. Rather than special-casing this in
every collector, TokenTracer normalizes model names in a dedicated stage that
runs **after `merge_records()` and before the SQLite upsert**, using a
**Pipes-and-Filters** pattern: an ordered chain of small, independent
transforms (filters) that each take the record list, decide whether they
apply, and hand back a (possibly modified) record list to the next stage.

### The `RecordMiddleware` protocol

Defined in `src/middleware/base.py`:

```python
class RecordMiddleware(Protocol):
    name: str

    def applies(self, records: list[SessionRecord]) -> bool: ...
    def process(self, records: list[SessionRecord]) -> list[SessionRecord]: ...
```

- `name` — a short identifier for the middleware.
- `applies(records)` — a cheap guard checked before `process()` runs.
- `process(records)` — returns the transformed record list.

### Wiring into `TrackerPipeline`

`TrackerPipeline.middlewares(*mw)` (`src/pipeline.py`) registers the chain.
Inside `run()`, after `merge_records()` and the context-label stamp, each
registered middleware runs in registration order:

```python
for mw in self._middlewares:
    if mw.applies(merged):
        merged = mw.process(merged)
```

**Guarantee**: `process()` is only ever called when `applies()` returns
`True` for the current record list — a middleware can never see `process()`
invoked without its own `applies()` check passing first. The `collect`
command (`src/commands/collect.py`, `_build_pipeline()`) registers the chain
via `.middlewares(ModelNormalizeMiddleware())` when it builds the pipeline.

### `ModelNormalizeMiddleware` — the first middleware

`ModelNormalizeMiddleware` (`src/middleware/model_normalize.py`) always
applies (`applies()` returns `True` unconditionally) and populates
`SessionRecord.canonical_model` for every record:

```python
def process(self, records: list[SessionRecord]) -> list[SessionRecord]:
    return [
        replace(r, canonical_model=normalize_model(r.model, r.source))
        for r in records
    ]
```

It never mutates a record — `SessionRecord` is frozen, so each output record
is a new instance built with `dataclasses.replace()`.

The actual normalization logic lives in `normalize_model(raw, source)`
(`src/model_normalize.py`) and resolves in a fixed order:

1. **Strip a trailing `-YYYYMMDD` date suffix** via regex (e.g.
   `claude-sonnet-4-5-20260101` → `claude-sonnet-4-5`).
2. **Look up `(source, raw)`** in the static alias table loaded from
   `src/model_aliases.toml`.
3. **Passthrough unchanged** if neither step matched.

`src/model_aliases.toml` is a static, cross-vendor alias table keyed first by
collector `source`, then by the raw string that source reports, mapping to
the canonical name:

```toml
[copilot_cli]
"claude-sonnet-4.5" = "claude-sonnet-4-5"
```

This lets two different harnesses' names for the same underlying model
collapse to one `canonical_model`, so reporting can group and filter by it
regardless of which collector produced the record. The alias table degrades
gracefully to empty if the TOML file is missing or malformed, so a bad or
absent alias file never crashes CLI startup.

### Adding a new middleware

1. Implement the `RecordMiddleware` protocol: `name`, `applies(records)`,
   `process(records)`.
2. Register an instance via `.middlewares(...)` on the `TrackerPipeline`
   where it's built — currently `_build_pipeline()` in
   `src/commands/collect.py`.
3. Remember `SessionRecord` is a **frozen dataclass** — `process()` must
   return new records built with `dataclasses.replace()`, never mutate a
   record in place.
4. Add tests under `tests/` covering both `applies()` and `process()`.

## Storage

`SqliteStore` (`src/stores/sqlite.py`) owns the local database
(`~/.tokentracer/usage.db` when installed; `usage.db` next to `tracker.py`
in a repo checkout; override with `--db`).

- **`sessions` table** — mirrors `SessionRecord`, with
  `PRIMARY KEY (session_id, source, model)` and `INSERT OR REPLACE` upserts.
- **`project_identities` table** — also lives in `usage.db`, keyed by a
  normalized (case-insensitive, trimmed) `cwd_key`, with stable `guid` and
  optional `whimsical_name` columns. It is local-only: `sync_log`,
  `unsynced_for()`, and remote-store upserts never reference it. Inspect it
  with `python3 tracker.py projects`.
- **`sync_log` table** — `PRIMARY KEY (session_id, source, model,
  store_name)`; tracks which rows have been pushed to which remote store,
  so `sync` is incremental and idempotent per store.
- **Migration** — on first connect, a legacy `usage` / `daily_activity`
  table from older versions is dropped with a warning asking the user to
  re-collect (`collect --lookback 90`).

The whimsical-name implementation lives in `src/whimsy/`, a self-contained
stdlib-only package with one public function, `generate_name(existing=None,
rng=None)`. `src/project_identity.py` is its only in-tree consumer, which
keeps the package extractable into its own repository later.

---

## Report flow

`UsageReporter` (`src/report.py`) reads only the local SQLite database.

- `--period` scopes every view: `day` (default, today) | `month` | `year` |
  `all` (no date filter).
- **Default view** — one row per session: Project, Source, Model, Start,
  End, Input, Output, Reasoning, CacheRead, CacheCreate, CacheHit%,
  CtxPeak, Turns, Tools.
- **`--summary`** — compact per-session view; combined with a period it
  becomes an aggregated roll-up grouped by period + model.
- **`--by-project`** — groups by project (requires a non-null
  `sessions.project`; default `--project-mode no` produces stable per-project
  GUIDs even when real names are masked).
- **`--detailed`** — dumps every row in the database regardless of date,
  with all 17 columns: Session, Source, Model, Date, Start, End, Project,
  Turns, Tools, Input, Output, CacheCreate, CacheRead, CtxPeak, Reasoning,
  Context, and **Synced** (comma-separated store names from `sync_log`,
  empty if never synced). Overrides `--summary` and `--by-project`; ignores
  `--period`; `--model` filter still applies; works with `--json`.
- **Cache hit %** = cache reads as a share of total input-side tokens; a
  header line reports cache efficiency for the selected period and models (cache reads cost ~10% of
  regular input tokens).
- `--model <name>` filters, `--json` emits machine-readable output.
- **Grouping and filtering use `COALESCE(canonical_model, model)`** — every
  query that groups or filters by model falls back to the raw `model` value
  when `canonical_model` is unset (e.g. rows collected before the middleware
  existed), so old and new rows for the same underlying model roll up
  together. `--detailed` additionally shows the raw `canonical_model` column
  alongside `model` so the two can be compared directly.

---

## Configuration

`Config.load()` (`src/config.py`) reads `~/.tokentracer/.tokentracer.toml`
(`C:\Users\<you>\.tokentracer\.tokentracer.toml` on Windows):

- `[tracking] track_project_names` (string, default `"no"`) — one of
  `"yes"` (real name), `"no"` (stable 12-hex guid per cwd), or
  `"whimsical"` (stable docker-style masked name). `tracker.py config set`
  validates the enum; invalid or legacy boolean TOML values warn and fall
  back to `"no"`. `collect --project-mode <yes|no|whimsical>` overrides it
  per run.
- `[tracking] context` (string, default `"personal"`) — usage-context label
  stamped on every collected record via `TrackerPipeline.context()`;
  `--context <label>` overrides per run.
- `[stores.<name>]` sections declare remote stores (see below).

`${VAR}` placeholders in string values are expanded at store instantiation:
lookup order is `os.environ` first, then `~/.tokentracer/.tokentracer.env` (simple
`KEY=VALUE` file; `#` comments and optional quotes supported). A missing
variable raises `ValueError`, so secrets never need to live in the TOML file.

`tracker.py config set <key> <value>` rewrites the TOML safely, preserving
other keys.

---

## Sync and the stores registry

Stores implement the `SessionStore` protocol (`src/stores/__init__.py`):
a `name: str` class attribute, `upsert(records) -> int`, and `close()`.

- **Discovery** — `load_store_registry()` (`src/stores/registry.py`) finds
  stores via the `tokentracer.stores` entry-point group declared in
  `pyproject.toml`. In a plain repo checkout (package not installed) it
  falls back to the built-ins: `sqlite` and `supabase`. External packages
  can ship stores through the same entry-point group.
- **Instantiation** — `instantiate_store(name, params, class_path=None)`
  expands `${VAR}` placeholders, then constructs the store by registry name,
  or by dotted `class_path` (bypassing the registry) if given.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CLI as tracker.py sync
    participant SQ as SqliteStore
    participant RS as Remote store (e.g. Supabase)

    CLI->>SQ: unsynced_for(store_name)
    SQ-->>CLI: rows never pushed to that store
    CLI->>RS: upsert(rows)
    RS-->>CLI: count
    CLI->>SQ: mark rows synced (sync_log)
    Note over CLI: --dry-run prints pending counts only.<br/>Failed stores are reported without blocking others;<br/>all stores closed in a finally.
```

The `collect` command also fans out to configured remote stores directly
(best-effort); `sync` is the catch-up path for rows that failed or were
collected while offline.

**Built-in Supabase store** (`src/stores/supabase.py`) — upserts into a
`token_sessions` table with `on_conflict="session_id,source,model"`
(mirroring the local primary key). The client is created lazily on first
upsert; requires the optional dependency `supabase>=2.0`
(`pip install tokentracer[supabase]`). The upserted payload includes
`tool_calls`, `reasoning_tokens`, and `context_peak_tokens`; the remote
`token_sessions` table must have those bigint columns (see `README.md` for
the full `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` migration snippets). Configuration:

```toml
[stores.supabase]
url = "${SUPABASE_URL}"
key = "${SUPABASE_KEY}"      # service role key (bypasses RLS)
table = "token_sessions"     # optional, this is the default
```

## Extending

### Adding a collector

1. Create `src/collectors/<name>.py` implementing `ActivityCollector`
   (`source` class attr + `collect(since) -> Iterable[SessionRecord]`).
2. Export it from `src/collectors/__init__.py`.
3. Add the relevant path to `Paths` in `src/config.py`.
4. Instantiate it in `_build_pipeline()` in `src/commands/collect.py`.
5. Add tests under `tests/` using `tmp_path` fixture files.

### Adding a store

1. Create `src/stores/<name>.py` implementing `SessionStore` (`name` class
   attr + `upsert` + `close`). Keep third-party imports optional (try/except
   at module level; raise a helpful `ImportError` on first use).
2. Register it under `[project.entry-points."tokentracer.stores"]` in
   `pyproject.toml` (and in the built-in fallback in `registry.py` if it
   ships with this repo).
3. Add any third-party dependency as an optional extra in
   `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
4. Add tests under `tests/` mocking the client
   (see `tests/test_supabase_store.py`).
5. Users enable it with a `[stores.<name>]` section in
   `~/.tokentracer/.tokentracer.toml`.

### Adding a middleware

See [Adding a new middleware](#adding-a-new-middleware) under
[Middleware](#middleware) for the full guide: implement `RecordMiddleware`
(`name`/`applies`/`process`) and register it via `.middlewares(...)` where
the pipeline is built (currently `_build_pipeline()` in
`src/commands/collect.py`). Remember `SessionRecord` is frozen — build new
records with `dataclasses.replace()`.

Nothing else needs to change — that is the point of the design.
